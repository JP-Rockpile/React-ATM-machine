# React-ATM-machine

In order to run this program you should host a local server to view the react application. I used npm http-server.

This application deposits an amount into an account and displays the balance on top. By changing to withdraw you can take cash back out. If your balance is less than the amount you wish to draw, it should not allow you to continue with the transaction. 

Clicking clear will remove the deposit or withdraw inputs. Clicking the view transaction history button will display the entire history of deposits and withdrawals.
